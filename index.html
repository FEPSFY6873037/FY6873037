         <p>The internet, one of the greatest inventions in human history. An invention allowing 
          near instant communication between people from nearly anywhere on the planet with 
          limited methods of regulating usage. As such this has spawned people using this service 
          for more harm than good. One example is the computer virus. “A computer virus is a type of malicious 
          software, or malware, that spreads between computers and causes damage to data and software. “What are Computer 
          viruses? Definitions and types of Viruses: available at <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/uk/resources/cyberglossary/computer-virus">(https://www.fortinet.com/uk/resources/cyberglossary/computer-virus)</a>(Last accessed on 1st December 2024)</p>

              This study intends on observing how computer viruses have evolved over the years in parallel with the internet, 
              this can hopefully be used to study and predict how they will change and hopefully attempt to minimize damage future viruses could cause.

              The internet, a term originally credited to Vint Cerf, is the word used to describe the system of interconnected
               networks we all use in our day to day lives allowing for all of us to stay connected. 
               The internet has grown exponentially since its inception with different pieces of software developing and

        ideologies as well as knowledge that both nations had access to weapons of mass destruction, The USA came up with a failsafe, 
        they wanted to create a long range communication system that can be used in the event of a long range missile attack, and so, in 1965 ARPANET was born,

        (Last accessed on 1st December 2024) This meant a lot of potential for money to be made on the internet. This resulted in a rapid increase in the stock market for any 
        internet-based companies, incentivising investments into companies providing internet services to users. One such company that was formed during this time period was Google.

          <p id = "9_text">After the burst of the Dot-com bubble the internet calmed down significantly, 
            a lot fewer web based companies started to get founded, but once these new companies got going they ran away, 
            take YouTube and Facebook as examples, launched on 2005 and 2004 respectively. Ever since the burst there have been a 
            few companies on top consitently hosting a majority of internet traffic.

            (Last accessed on 1st December 2024), both of these sources show how most of the internet traffic is concentrated
             around massive companies like Google YouTube or Facebook. This pattern has been consitent for years 
             where Google and other companies have effecively developed a method to generate as much profit 
             as effecively as possible using data harvesting.</p>

          <p id = "10_text">This approach is mirrored with most modern viruses, these days you will be hard pressed to find a virus that doesn’t 
            attempt to extract as much cash from an innocent person as possible. With WannaCry being a prolific example of a virus 
            attempting to extract money out of innocent people with threats that they will lose all personal data unless

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p id = "11_text">This paper has discussed the evolution of computer viruses as they 
        have evolved alongside the internet. The paper has shown that as the internet 
        has grown, it has evolved alongside all its other non-harmful content, 
        going from artistic to attempting to generate as much profit as possible over as short a 
        time as possible. Mirroring how companies such as Google use the internet, granted in a less harmful 
        method. During this process I have learned how to effectively learned the history of the internet and 
        the progress of viruses over the last 34 as well as learning how to effectively reference any sources I 
        used in the progress of writing this paper.</p>
