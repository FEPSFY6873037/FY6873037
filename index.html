            The internet, a term originally credited to Vint Cerf, is the word used to describe the system of interconnected
             networks we all use in our day to day lives allowing for all of us to stay connected. 
             The internet has grown exponentially since its inception with different pieces of software developing and 
             changing in parallel with the internet.

            This paper will look at how we can use computer viruses to study how the internet has changed through the decades 
            starting with the creation of the ARPAnet all the way up to the modern day state of the internet and where most internet traffic 
            is concentrated these days with demonstrations of computer viruses from the different eras of the internet.

          The internet, one of the greatest inventions in human history. 
          An invention allowing near instant communication between people 
          from nearly anywhere on the planet with limited methods of regulating usage. As such, 
          over the years there has spawned a multitude of people trying to use the internet for more harmful ways than good.
        </p>
        <p>
          One instance of harmful acts that has stemmed from the internet access is the computer virus. 
          “A computer virus is a type of malicious software, or malware, that spreads between computers and causes damage to data and software“. 
          What are Computer viruses? Definitions and types of Viruses: available at <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/uk/resources/cyberglossary/computer-virus">(https://www.fortinet.com/uk/resources/cyberglossary/computer-virus)</a> 
          (Accessed: 1st December 2024), these pieces of harmful software have been in around in 
          corners of the internet ever since the start of the first interconnected networks and as the internet has developed over the last couple of 
          decades computer viruses have changed in a variety of ways.

      <h1>ARPANET</h1>
      <p>Back in the 1950s, due to tensions between the USA and the Soviet Union starting to build because of differing 
        ideologies as well as knowledge that both nations had access to weapons of mass destruction, The USA came up with a failsafe, 
        they wanted to create a long range communication system that can be used in the event of a long range missile attack, and so, in 1965 ARPANET was born, 
        the first ever long range network. A history of the internet | National Science and Media Museum: available at

         (accessed 1st December 2024). ARPANET existed as a branch of the US department of defense until the invention of the 
         world wide web in 1990, the first ever wide area network open to the entire world.</p>
         <p>The launch of the world wide web meant dozens of individuals were able to get in contact with each other and created programs for each other,
             these groups all created programs that spread between one another in these groups.
              These were the first computer viruses distributed on the world wide web.</p>

          <p>Most of the original computer viruses would only affect the MSDOS system, one example of this is crash.600. This virus would infect all .

      <h1>The DOT-COM bubble</h1>
      <p>In the coming years personal computers would become significantly more accessible with them becoming smaller and more affordable for the average person. 
        UK households; ownership of home computers 1985-2018: available at <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/289191/household-penetration-of-home-computers-in-the-uk/">(https://www.statista.com/statistics/289191/household-penetration-of-home-computers-in-the-uk/)</a> 
        (accessed on 1st December 2024) This meant that a lot of money was potential to be made over the internet. This resulted in a rapid increase in the stock market for any 
        internet-based companies, this incentivized investments into companies providing internet services to users, one such company that was formed during this time period was Google.

      <p>During this time period internet traffic fluctuated massively, with companies being founded and going bust all of the time, where internet traffic 
        was never wholly concentrated around three or four different domains. The Most Visited Websites Every Year Since 1995: available at

        (accessed 1st December 2024). This stage of the internet was completely different from the one we have today, during that stage of the internet,
         interest in websites and the potential for unique and groundbreaking websites was at an all time high, it resulted in some of the most ideas for 
         websites being published in the public domain, some not as groundbreaking as others but still being fun and interesting by themselves. For example,
          DPGraph.com <a href="http://www.dpgraph.com/">(http://www.dpgraph.com/)</a> (accessed on 1st December 2024), a website still up today that has hardly changed since it was 
          originally published in 2005, DPGraph 2000: Dynamic Photorealistic Graphing: archived from internet archive on 19th October 2000 
          <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001019004433/http://www.dpgraph.com/">(http://web.archive.org/web/20001019004433/http://www.dpgraph.com/)</a> (accessed on 1st December 2024).</p>
      <p>This change on the internet had a drastic change to computer viruses, going from what was originally an art 
        project mixed with a prank into an issue which causes real damage. These new breeds of computer viruses were only made for
         the explicit purpose of spreading and infecting more machines. They were mostly made to test the limits of the internet 
         and to see how far you can spread through a system and cause as much damage as possible along the way.</p>
      <div id="bubble_container">
        <div>
          <p>One of these such viruses was named ILOVEYOU, on account of it spreading as a file attached to an email posing as a love letter 
            which would email itself to any email contacts and as a result would be self-propagating. 
            On 4th May 2000 this virus was sent over the internet and within 24 hours had infected over 45 million systems, 
            infecting around 10% of all internet connected computers. I Love You (virus) -  computer Museum of America:
